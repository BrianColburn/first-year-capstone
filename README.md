The executable `logicians-main` can be built by running `make`

Current operations supported include outputting a sample HTML table and applying transformations to expressions.
Future releases will include outputting proper truth tables to both HTML and TXT files.
Given enough time/boredom, an REPL may feature-creep its way into the transformation options.

Class documentation can be found in the header files or here: http://riddler.tamucc.edu/~bcolburn/logicians/
